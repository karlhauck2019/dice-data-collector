DICE is a tool created by VMware to consume customer environment data and use it to build a functional return on investment model.
<p></p>
The Data Collector for DICE is deployed in a customer environment to collect data from vRealize Operations Manager.
<p></p>
The following data is collected:
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Virtual Machine Object Properties and Metrics</li>
    <li>Host Machine Object Properties and Metrics</li>
    <li>Cluster Object Metrics</li>
    <li>Distributed Virtual Switch Object Metrics</li>
    <li>Portgroup Object Metrics</li>
    <li>Datastore Object Metrics</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
All of this data is dumped into a JSON formatted file that can be uploaded into the DICE tool.
